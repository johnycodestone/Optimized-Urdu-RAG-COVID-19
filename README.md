# Optimizing-RAG-for-Low-Resource-Languages-A-Case-Study-on-Urdu-COVID-19

This repository houses the source code, training data files, and methodology for a research study focused on Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Low-Resource Languages. Using Urdu as a case study and COVID-19 medical data as the target domain, this project addresses the unique challenges of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to languages with limited digital corpora.

By implementing a specialized retrieval pipeline and fine-tuning generator models on a curated Urdu dataset, we achieved exceptional accuracy and semantic coherence. This work serves as a benchmark for bridging the "language gap" in AI, ensuring that advanced NLP techniques effectively serve non-English speaking populations in critical domains like healthcare.
